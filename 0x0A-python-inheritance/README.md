This project explores Python's inheritance concepts through various tasks. Each document addresses specific objectives, such as listing attributes/methods, implementing a sorted list class, checking class instances, and creating subclasses.

0-lookup.py: Returns a list of available attributes and methods of an object.
1-my_list.py: Defines a class MyList that inherits from list and includes a method to print the sorted list.
2-is_same_class.py: Implements a function to check if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.
3-is_kind_of_class.py: Provides a function to check if an object is an instance of or inherits from a specified class.
4-inherits_from.py: Determines if an object is an instance of a class that inherited from the specified class.
5-base_geometry.py: Defines an empty class BaseGeometry.
6-base_geometry.py: Extends BaseGeometry with a method that raises an "area not implemented" exception.
7-base_geometry.py: Adds an integer validation method to the BaseGeometry class.
8-rectangle.py: Creates a Rectangle class inheriting from BaseGeometry with validated width and height.
9-rectangle.py: Enhances the Rectangle class with an area method and a custom print format.
10-square.py: Introduces a Square class inheriting from Rectangle with a size attribute.
11-square.py: Improves the Square class with a custom print format.
100-my_int.py: Defines a class
